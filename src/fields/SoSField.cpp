  \class SoSField SoSField.h Inventor/fields/SoSField.h
  \brief The SoSField class is the base class for fields which contains
  only a single value.
  \ingroup fields

  All field types which should always contain only a single member
  value inherits this class. SoSField is an abstract class.

  You use methods setValue() and getValue() to store or fetch the
  value of single-value fields. Example:

  \code
    SoSpotLight * lightnode = new SoSpotLight;
    lightnode->on.setValue(TRUE); // The "on" field of SoSpotLight is
                                  // a single value field of type SoSFBool.
    ...
    ...
    // Change lightswitch.
    if (lightnode->on.getValue() == FALSE)
      lightnode->on = TRUE; // We can use operator = instead of setValue().
    else
      lightnode->on = FALSE;
    ...
  \endcode

  When nodes, engines or other types of field containers are written
  to file, their single-value fields are written to file in this
  format:

  \code
    containerclass {
      fieldname value
      fieldname value
      ...
    }
  \endcode

  ..like this, for instance, a SpotLight node from a scene
  graph which will be default \e off when read back from file:

  \code
    SpotLight {
      on FALSE
    }
  \endcode
