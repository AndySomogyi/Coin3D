  The WorldInfo node contains information about the world. This node
  is strictly for documentation purposes and has no effect on the
  visual appearance or behaviour of the world. The \e title field is
  intended to store the name or title of the world so that browsers
  can present this to the user (perhaps in the window border). Any
  other information about the world can be stored in the \e info
  field, such as author information, copyright, and usage
  instructions.
