  \class SoFullPath Inventor/SoFullPath.h
  \brief The SoFullPath class allows examination of hidden children in paths.
  \ingroup general

  SoPath allows only access from the head node to the first node with
  hidden children, but not any further.

  Since the SoFullPath is derived from SoPath and contains no private
  data, you can cast SoPath instances to the SoFullPath type.  This
  will allow you to examine hidden children.

  (Actually, you are not supposed to allocate instances of this class
  at all. It is only available as an "extended interface" into the
  superclass SoPath.)

/*!
  \fn void SoFullPath::pop(void)

  This method overrides SoPath::pop() to allow clients to get at all
  the nodes in the path.
