  \class SoFaceDetail SoFaceDetail.h Inventor/details/SoFaceDetail.h
  \brief The SoFaceDetail class is for storing detailed polygon information.
  \ingroup details

  Instances of this class are used among other things for storing
  information about polygons after pick operations, and for storing
  information returned to tessellation callbacks.

  Note that a SoFaceDetail instance consists of a set of SoPointDetail
  instances, one for each vertex of the polygon it represents.
