  \class SoInterpolate SoInterpolate.h Inventor/engines/SoInterpolate.h
  \brief The SoInterpolate class is the base class for all interpolator engines.
  \ingroup engines

  Interpolators are used to linearly interpolate between two values.

  In Coin, we've chosen to implement all interpolators in separate
  files. If you want to be OIV compatible when programming, you should
  include the SoInterpolate.h, and not the interpolator file(s) you
  need.

/*!
  \var SoSFFloat SoInterpolate::alpha

  The value which says how much we've should interpolate from first
  value to second value. A value equal to 0 will give an output equal
  to the first value, alpha equal to 1 gives the second value, any
  value in between gives a "weighted" interpolation between the two
  values.
*/
/*!
  \var SoEngineOutput SoInterpolate::output

  Interpolated values from the input fields. The type of the output
  will of course be the same as the type of the input fields of each
  non-abstract subclass inheriting SoInterpolate.
