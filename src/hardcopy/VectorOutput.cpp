  \brief The SoVectorOutput class is used for setting vector output file.
  \ingroup hardcopy

  SoVectorizeAction will create an SoVectorOutput which will output
  to stdout by default. SoVectorizeAction::getOutput() can be used to
  fetch this output, and the user will probably want to set a
  file to output to.

  \since Coin 2.1
  \since TGS provides HardCopy support as a separate extension for TGS Inventor.
