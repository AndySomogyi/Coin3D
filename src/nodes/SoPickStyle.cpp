  \class SoPickStyle SoPickStyle.h Inventor/nodes/SoPickStyle.h
  \brief The SoPickStyle class is a node for setting up how to do picking.
  \ingroup nodes

  By default, all geometry in a scene is available for picking. Upon
  writing applications with interaction possibilities, this is often
  \e not what you want. To exclude parts of the scene graph from pick
  actions, use the SoPickStyle::UNPICKABLE.

  You can also optimize pick operations by using the
  SoPickStyle::BOUNDING_BOX pickstyle.

  <b>FILE FORMAT/DEFAULTS:</b>
  \code
    PickStyle {
        style SHAPE
    }
  \endcode

  \enum SoPickStyle::Style

  Enumeration of the available picking strategies.

/*!
  \var SoPickStyle::Style SoPickStyle::SHAPE

  Do "exact" picks, finding the correct intersection point(s), etc.
*/
/*!
  \var SoPickStyle::Style SoPickStyle::BOUNDING_BOX

  Only compare pick intersection with the bounding boxes of
  shapes. This is usually much faster than SoPickStyle::SHAPE.
*/
/*!
  \var SoPickStyle::Style SoPickStyle::UNPICKABLE

  The geometry following this node in the scene will not be available
  for picking.
*/
/*!
  \var SoPickStyle::Style SoPickStyle::SHAPE_ON_TOP

  Do exact picks, like SHAPE, but sort the shape to the front of the
  list of picked points so it appears to be the frontmost item. This
  does not affect the SoPickedPoint pick coordinate though, just the
  sorting by depth done on the picked point list.

*/
/*!
  \var SoPickStyle::Style SoPickStyle::BOUNDING_BOX_ON_TOP

  Do picks against the enclosing bounding box of the object, like
  BOUNDING_BOX, but sort the shape to the front of the list of picked
  points so it appears to be the frontmost item. This does not affect
  the SoPickedPoint pick coordinate though, just the sorting by depth
  done on the picked point list.

  \since Coin 3.0
*/
/*!
  \var SoPickStyle::Style SoPickStyle::SHAPE_FRONTFACES

  Do exact picks, like SHAPE, but cull all the backface intersections
  from the list. Note that this logic is relative to the ray, not the
  view, in case the ray and the view direction are not aligned.

  The behaviour of this setting will also depend on the SoShapeStyle
  vertexOrdering and shapeType setting, which are used to flip
  frontfaces to become backfaces and vice versa and to turn backface
  culling on and off.
