  \class SoReversePerspectiveCamera SoReversePerspectiveCamera.h Inventor/nodes/SoReversePerspectiveCamera.h
  \brief The SoReversePerspectiveCamera class defines a camera node with reverse perspective rendering.
  \ingroup nodes

  For realistic looking 3D scene, the geometry should be rendered with
  perspective calculations. Use this camera type to accomplish this.

  Reverse perspective rendering, a special case of perspective rendering, is
  where the projection rays do not converge in the eye of the observer, but
  instead at a point behind the scene. Thus objects farther away from the
  observer appear larger than closer objects. A reverse perspective projection
  is defined by
    - setting the perspective camera position to the projection point behind the scene
	- setting near / far distance to negative values
    - rotating the camera orientation by 180 degree around the camera z axis
  to compensate the image flip induced by the negative near / far values.

  The view volume of the default reverse perspective camera is defined as shown below.
