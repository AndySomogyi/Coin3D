  \class SoCallback SoCallback.h Inventor/nodes/SoCallback.h
  \brief The SoCallback class is a node type which provides a means of setting callback hooks in the scene graph.
  \ingroup nodes

  By inserting SoCallback nodes in a scene graph, the application
  programmer can set up functions to be executed at certain points in
  the traversal.

  The callback function will be executed during traversal of \e any
  action, so check the type of the \a action argument of the callback
  function if you only want to run your code at specific actions.

  <b>FILE FORMAT/DEFAULTS:</b>
  \code
    Callback {
    }
  \endcode

/*!
  Set up the \a function to call at traversal of this node. \a
  userdata will be passed back as the first argument of the callback
  \a function. Setting \a function to NULL removes the previously set 
  callback function.

  If you want a callback only for a specific action, you must (in your
  callback function) remember to check which action invoked the
  callback, for instance like this:

  \code
  
  void mycallback(void * userdata, SoAction * action)
  {
    if (action->isOfType(SoGLRenderAction::getClassTypeId())) {
      // do stuff specific for GL rendering here.
    }
  }

  \endcode

  Please note that SoCallback nodes under a Separator might be
  included in a cache. Cached nodes are not traversed, and you'll not
  receive any callbacks. If you want to make sure that your callback
  is called every time the scene graph is rendered, you must
  invalidate the render cache in your callback:

  \code
  
  void mycallback(void * userdata, SoAction * action)
  {
    if (action->isOfType(SoGLRenderAction::getClassTypeId())) {
      SoCacheElement::invalidate(action->getState());
    }
  }

  \endcode

  If you want to invalidate all caches (for instance also the bounding
  box cache), you can do this in your callback:

  \code
  
  void mycallback(void * userdata, SoAction * action)
  {
    SoState * state = action->getState();
    if (state->isElementEnabled(SoCacheElement::getClassStackIndex())) {
      SoCacheElement::invalidate(state);
    }
  }

  \endcode
