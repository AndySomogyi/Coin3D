  \class SoAlphaTest SoAlphaTest.h
  \brief The SoAlphaTest class is a node used to control the GL alpha test function.

  With this node you can control the OpenGL alpha test function. The
  alpha test function enables you to discard fragments based on its
  alpha value. For instance, if you set the function to GREATER and
  value to 0.5, only fragments with alpha value greater than 0.5 will
  be rendered.

  Alpha testing is typically used when rendering textures where all
  pixels are either completely opaque or completely
  transparent. Transparency sorting propblems are avoided when alpha
  testing is used instead of blending, since depth testing can still
  be enabled and no sorting or delayed rendering is needed.

  To enable alpha testing instead of transparency blending, insert a
  TransparencyType node with value = NONE, and an AlphaTest node with
  \e function set to GREATER and \e value set to for instance 0.01.
