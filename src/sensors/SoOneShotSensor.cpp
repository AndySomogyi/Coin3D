  \class SoOneShotSensor SoOneShotSensor.h Inventor/sensors/SoOneShotSensor.h
  \brief The SoOneShotSensor class is a sensor which will trigger once.
  \ingroup sensors

  Since SoOneShotSensor is a subclass of SoDelayQueueSensor, it will
  trigger as soon as either the run-time system is idle, or if it is
  continually busy it will trigger within a fixed amount of time (this
  is by default 1/12th of a second, see
  SoSensorManager::setDelaySensorTimeout()).
