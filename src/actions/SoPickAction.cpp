  \class SoPickAction SoPickAction.h Inventor/actions/SoPickAction.h
  \brief The SoPickAction class is the base class for picking actions.
  \ingroup actions

  The basis for all interaction features that Coin provides for the
  application programmer is the pick actions. Draggers, manipulators,
  SoSelection nodes, etc all make use of the functionality provided by
  the pick actions for selecting and manipulating scene geometry in
  various ways.

  This class is not supposed to be used directly by the application
  programmer, as it is more a place-holder for the common interface of
  picking operations. It does not contain any actual code for doing
  scenegraph picks.

  Coin provides a fully functional picking action for the application
  programmer to use through the SoRayPickAction class (which inherits
  the SoPickAction class).
