  \brief The SoButtonEvent class is the base class for all button events.
  \ingroup events

  The event classes which results from the user pushing buttons on
  some device (keyboard, mouse or spaceball) all inherit this
  class. The SoButtonEvent class contains methods for setting and
  getting the state of the button(s).
