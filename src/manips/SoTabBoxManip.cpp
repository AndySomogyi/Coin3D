  \class SoTabBoxManip SoTabBoxManip.h Inventor/manips/SoTabBoxManip.h
  \brief The SoTabBoxManip class wraps an SoTabBoxDragger.
  \ingroup manips

  <center>
  <img src="http://doc.coin3d.org/images/Coin/draggers/tabbox.png">
  </center>

  The SoTabBoxManip provides a convenient mechanism for the
  application programmer for setting up an SoTabBoxDragger in the
  scene connected to the relevant fields of an SoTransform node.

  The interaction from the end-user with the manipulator will then
  automatically influence the transformation matrix for the geometry
  following it in the scenegraph.
