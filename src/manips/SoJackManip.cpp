  \brief The SoJackManip wraps an SoJackDragger for convenience.
  \ingroup manips

  The manipulator class takes care of wrapping up the SoJackDragger in
  a simple and convenient API for the application programmer, making
  it automatically surround the geometry it influences and taking care
  of the book-keeping routines for it's interaction with the relevant
  fields of an SoTransformation node.
