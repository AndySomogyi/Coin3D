  The float-version of the math functions below did not come about
  until C99, so we don't want to use them internally, for portability
  reasons.

  This block was originally part of Inventor/C/basic.h, but since the
  #undef's were mangled by the config.status process, it did not really
  work as intended.  20070518 larsa
 
 cmath from "The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure" uses float-versions of the
 math functions below. Therefore don't undefine them when __clang__ is
 defined.
